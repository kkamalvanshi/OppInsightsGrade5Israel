# OppInsightsGrade5Israel

Goal/Purpose: Opportunity Insights gives Game Theory students a challenge with Empirical Project 2: "Do Smaller Classes Improve Test Scores? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design" As a way to expand my knowledge on Machine Learning, I decided to create a predictor for average math and verbal test scores based on factors such as the number of students enrolled, class size, percentage of students with disadvantages, gender ratio, and religiousness. The data used was from grade 5 schools in Israel. The method of data collection is not known.

Uses: Economists who work on public policy can understand how certain factors can impact average math and verbal test scores and with this understanding, can shape public policy to have schools aim for higher test scores.

Data: The data used comes from Opportunity Insights (in the Empirical Project 2 zip file): https://opportunityinsights.org/course/

Data structure concepts: Machine Learning, PANDAS Library, SciKit, Random Forest Regression

Output: Predicted Average Test Math and Average Verbal Scores of Inputted Grade 5 class in Israel

Accuracy Rate of Regression Model: 90.95%
